# Quantum Particle Simulator (Rebound Particles)

An interactive quantum particle physics simulation application developed with Flutter, demonstrating particle collisions, trajectory tracking and 3D rendering effects.

## Project Overview

The Quantum Particle Simulator is a visually rich physics simulation application that demonstrates particle motion, collisions and interactions in three-dimensional space. The application features modern UI design and smooth animations for an immersive physics simulation experience.

## Key Features

- **Particle Physics Simulation**: Simulates particle motion and collisions in 3D space
- **Container Boundary Collisions**: Particle collision detection and rebound with cylindrical and spherical containers
- **Particle Trajectory Tracking**: Displays particle motion trails creating aesthetic visual effects
- **Interactive Operations**: Users can select/drag particles and observe their trajectories
- **Pulse Wave Effects**: Trigger pulse wave animations affecting surrounding particles
- **3D Rendering**: Custom renderer implementing 3D effects and lighting
- **Quantum Visual Effects**: Halo and energy effects generated by particle collisions
